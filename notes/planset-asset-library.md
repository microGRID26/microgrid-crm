# Planset asset library — status tracking

> Live status of every SVG asset in the SLD asset library. Updated as Claude Design ships drafts and Atlas integrates.

See `notes/planset-ahj-standard.md` for the architecture and per-asset workflow. See `~/.claude/plans/cozy-herding-quilt.md` for the master phase plan.

## Status legend

- **spec** — Atlas has written the spec, not yet sent to Claude Design
- **drafting** — Sent to Claude Design, awaiting SVG deliverable
- **integrating** — SVG received, Atlas wiring it into the asset registry
- **integrated** — Live in registry, rendering on Tyson PV-5
- **verified** — Compared against Tyson reference at print scale, matches
- **blocked** — Iteration needed; describe in notes column
