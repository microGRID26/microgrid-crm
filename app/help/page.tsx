        Your home base. Shows projects needing attention (Pending Resolution or Revision Required tasks),

        today's schedule. Start here every morning — sections are sorted by urgency.

      <Card title="My Queue">
        Shows only your active projects with tasks that need action. Each card shows the next incomplete task,

        then critical, then at-risk.

      </Card>
      <Card title="SLA Thresholds">
        Edit the target, risk, and critical day thresholds for each of the 7 pipeline stages. Saves to
        the sla_thresholds table in Supabase. Note: the live app currently uses the values from this table

      <Card title="Full codebase audit">
        Every file in the codebase was audited for bugs, silent failures, and architecture issues. Key findings
        and fixes applied this session are listed below. Remaining items are tracked internally for future sessions.
      </Card>
      <Card title="ProjectPanel — all Info fields now fully editable">
        All fields in the Info tab are now editable in edit mode, including: contract amount, system kW,
        financier, financing type, down payment, TPO escalator, advance payment schedule, dealer, all equipment
        fields (module, inverter, battery, optimizer + quantities), all site and electrical fields (meter location,

        Previously, clicking Save Changes without touching every field could silently drop data for untouched
        fields. Edit mode now pre-loads all current values into the draft so Save always sends the correct
        complete state to the database.
      </Card>
      <Card title="ProjectPanel — AHJ info card more reliable">
        The AHJ info card (phone, website, permit notes shown below the AHJ field) now uses a fuzzy
        contains-match to find the right AHJ record. Previously an exact-match was used, which caused the
        info card to silently show nothing if the project's AHJ name had minor formatting differences
        from the database record.
      </Card>
      <Card title="ProjectPanel — Drive folder lookup fixed">
        The Files tab was silently throwing a database error for projects with no linked Drive folder.
        This caused unexpected behavior in some cases. Now handled correctly — projects without a Drive
        folder simply show the "No folder linked" message.
      </Card>
      <Card title="ProjectPanel — header syncs after stage advance">
        After advancing a project's stage from within the panel, the stage label and day counters in the
        panel header now update immediately without needing to close and reopen the panel.

        In the project Info tab, the AHJ, Utility, and HOA fields are now clickable green links that open
        detailed edit modals with all associated contact and portal information.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Bug fixes — 6 issues resolved">
        <Ul items={[
          'Stage label "Completion" corrected to "Complete" across all views',
          'Funding page: Days Waiting column now renders correctly',

      </Card>
      <Card title="Code refactor — SLA thresholds and task lists centralized">
        SLA thresholds and stage task lists were previously copy-pasted in 4 separate files. They now live
        in a single place (lib/utils.ts) and are imported everywhere.
      </Card>
