### Creating a New Project

On pages that support it (Command, Queue, Pipeline), a **+ New Project** button appears in the navigation bar. Click it to open the New Project modal.

---

## Command Center

**URL:** `/command`

The Command Center is your daily home base. It gives you a bird's-eye view of every active project, organized by urgency so you know exactly where to focus your attention.

### Metric Cards

At the top of the page, summary metric cards display counts for each classification. Click any card to jump to and expand that section.

### Project Classifications

Projects are sorted into sections in priority order. Each section is collapsible -- click the section header to expand or collapse it.

#### 1. Overdue Tasks
Projects with tasks that are past their scheduled completion date. These need immediate attention.

#### 2. Blocked
Projects with an active blocker. The blocker reason appears as a badge on the project row. A blocker is automatically set when a task enters "Pending Resolution" status, and automatically cleared when the stuck task is resolved (as long as no other tasks remain stuck).

- **Badge color:** Red background with red text

#### 3. Pending Resolution
Projects that have tasks in "Pending Resolution" status but are not yet at Critical or At Risk SLA levels. These are waiting on external action (customer response, AHJ reply, etc.).

#### 4. Critical (Past SLA)
Projects that have exceeded the critical SLA threshold for their current stage. These are the most time-sensitive active projects.

- **Badge color:** Red background (`bg-red-900 text-red-300`)

#### 5. At Risk
Projects approaching the critical SLA threshold. They have passed the risk threshold but not yet the critical threshold.

- **Badge color:** Amber/orange background (`bg-amber-900 text-amber-300`)

#### 6. Stalled
Projects with acceptable SLA but no movement for 5 or more days. Nothing is technically wrong, but they are not progressing. Check if any action is needed.

#### 7. Aging
Projects with a total cycle time of 90 or more days (measured from sale date). Even if SLA is fine, these have been in the pipeline too long.

#### 8. On Track
Projects with healthy SLA status and no blockers. These are progressing normally.

#### 9. Loyalty
Projects with a "Loyalty" disposition. These are existing customers being managed for additional work.

#### 10. In Service
Projects with an "In Service" disposition. These have completed the pipeline and are in post-installation service mode.

### SLA Badges

Every project row shows an SLA badge indicating how many days the project has been in its current stage:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green | On track -- within target SLA |
| Yellow | Warning -- approaching risk threshold |
| Amber/Orange | At risk -- past risk threshold |
| Red | Critical -- past critical SLA threshold |

**Note: SLA indicators are currently paused.** All thresholds are temporarily set to 999 days, so all projects appear as "On Track" for SLA purposes. The original threshold values are preserved and will be re-enabled in a future update.

The original SLA thresholds by stage (currently paused):

| Stage | Target | Risk | Critical |
|-------|--------|------|----------|
| Evaluation | 3 days | 4 days | 6 days |
| Site Survey | 3 days | 5 days | 10 days |
| Design | 3 days | 5 days | 10 days |
| Permitting | 21 days | 30 days | 45 days |
| Installation | 5 days | 7 days | 10 days |
| Inspection | 14 days | 21 days | 30 days |
| Complete | 3 days | 5 days | 7 days |

### Stuck Task Badges

Below each project row, you may see small badges indicating tasks that are stuck:

- **Red badge** -- Task in "Pending Resolution" status, with the reason displayed
- **Amber badge** -- Task in "Revision Required" status, with the reason displayed

### Project Row Information

Each project row in the Command Center shows:

- Project ID (e.g., PROJ-30456)
- Customer name

**URL:** `/queue`

The Queue page is your personal worklist. It shows projects filtered to your PM assignment, organized into task-based sections so you can see exactly what needs attention.

### PM Filter

- Use the PM dropdown at the top to select your name
- Your selection is remembered in your browser for future visits
- Select "All PMs" to see every project in the system (useful for managers)

### Queue Sections

Projects are organized into collapsible sections based on their current task state. All sections start collapsed except "Follow-ups Today." Click any section header to expand or collapse it.

#### 1. Follow-ups Today
Projects that have a follow-up date (set on a task or on the project itself) that is today or overdue. Shows the task name and whether the follow-up is due today or how many days overdue it is.

#### 2. City Permit Approval -- Ready to Start
Projects where the City Permit Approval task is ready to be worked (all prerequisites are met). These are permits you need to submit.

#### 3. City Permit -- Submitted, Pending Approval
Projects where the City Permit Approval task is actively being tracked (In Progress, Scheduled, Pending Resolution, or Revision Required). These are permits you are waiting on.

#### 4. Utility Permit -- Submitted, Pending Approval

### Task Statuses

Each task can be in one of seven statuses:

| Status | Badge Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Not Ready | Dark gray (`bg-gray-800 text-gray-500`) | Prerequisites not done. Task is locked and cannot be changed. |
| Ready To Start | Medium gray (`bg-gray-700 text-gray-200`) | Prerequisites are complete. Task can be started. |
| In Progress | Blue (`bg-blue-900 text-blue-300`) | Task is actively being worked on. |
| Scheduled | Indigo (`bg-indigo-900 text-indigo-300`) | Task has been scheduled for a specific date. |
| Pending Resolution | Red (`bg-red-900 text-red-300`) | Task is blocked, waiting on external action. |
| Revision Required | Amber (`bg-amber-900 text-amber-300`) | Task needs rework. Triggers cascade reset. |
| Complete | Green (`bg-green-900 text-green-300`) | Task is finished. |

### How to Change a Task Status

1. Open the Project Panel and go to the Tasks tab
2. Navigate to the stage containing the task (use the stage pills at the top)
3. Find the task row -- if it shows a dropdown on the right, you can change it
4. Select the new status from the dropdown
5. If selecting Pending Resolution or Revision Required, you will be prompted to select a reason

### Per-Task Notes

Each task has its own notes section. To add a note to a task:

1. Open the Project Panel and go to the Tasks tab
2. Find the task row
3. Click the **chat icon** next to the task name
4. A note input area appears below the task
5. Type your note and press Enter or click Add
6. Notes are timestamped with your name and visible to all team members
7. Per-task notes are separate from the project-level Notes tab

Use task notes for task-specific updates like "Submitted permit application ref #12345" or "Customer called, will sign by Friday."

### Follow-Up Dates

You can set a follow-up date on any task to remind yourself to check back:

1. Open the Project Panel and go to the Tasks tab
2. Find the task row
3. Click the **calendar icon** next to the task
4. Select a follow-up date
5. On the follow-up date, the project will appear in your Queue's "Follow-ups Today" section

Follow-up dates are especially useful for tasks in Pending Resolution where you are waiting on an external party and want to check back on a specific date.

### Prerequisites and Unlocking

- Tasks with unmet prerequisites are shown as dimmed/locked with "Not Ready" status
- You cannot change a locked task
- When all prerequisite tasks are marked Complete, the dependent task **automatically unlocks to "Ready To Start"** -- you do not need to manually change it
- This auto-unlock works across stage boundaries (e.g., completing Engineering Approval in Design automatically unlocks HOA Approval, OM Review, City Permit, and Utility Permit in Permitting)
- Prerequisites flow across stages (e.g., Engineering Approval in Design requires Build Engineering)

### AHJ-Conditional Requirements

Some tasks are normally optional but become required depending on the project's AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction):

- **WP1** and **WPI 2 & 8** are **required** for projects in **Corpus Christi** and **Texas City**
- For all other AHJs, these tasks remain optional

When a task is conditionally required, it is marked with a green asterisk (*) just like other required tasks, and it must be completed before the stage can advance.

### Required vs Optional Tasks

- Required tasks are marked with a green asterisk (*)
- Optional tasks are marked with "(opt)"
- Only required tasks must be Complete for the project to advance to the next stage
- Optional tasks do not block stage advancement

### Automations

When you change a task status, several automations may fire automatically:

#### Auto-Populate Dates
When certain tasks are marked Complete, the system automatically sets the corresponding project date field:

| Task | Date Field Set |
|------|---------------|
| NTP Procedure | NTP Date |
| Schedule Site Survey | Survey Scheduled Date |
| Site Survey | Survey Complete Date |
| City Permit Approval | City Permit Date |
| Utility Permit Approval | Utility Permit Date |
| Schedule Installation | Install Scheduled Date |
| Installation Complete | Install Complete Date |
| City Inspection | City Inspection Date |
| Utility Inspection | Utility Inspection Date |
| Permission to Operate | PTO Date |
| In Service | In Service Date |

#### Auto-Advance Stage
When all required tasks in a stage are marked Complete, the project automatically advances to the next pipeline stage. A stage history record is created.

#### Auto-Detect Blockers
When a task is set to "Pending Resolution," the project's blocker field is automatically set to the task's reason (prefixed with a pause icon). When the stuck task is resolved, the blocker is automatically cleared -- but only if no other tasks remain stuck.

#### Funding Milestone Triggers
- When "Installation Complete" is marked Complete, the M2 milestone becomes Eligible
- When "Permission to Operate" is marked Complete, the M3 milestone becomes Eligible
- If no funding record exists, one is automatically created

#### Task Duration Tracking
- When a task moves to "In Progress," its start date is automatically recorded
- When it is later marked Complete, the duration is calculated

#### Revision Cascade
When a task is set to "Revision Required," all downstream tasks within the same stage that depend on it (directly or transitively) are reset to "Not Ready." Before this happens, a confirmation dialog appears showing which tasks will be affected. The corresponding auto-populated dates are also cleared.

#### Auto-Set In Service Disposition
When the "In Service" task is completed, the project's disposition is automatically set to "In Service."

#### Auto-Unlock Dependent Tasks
When a task is marked Complete, any tasks whose prerequisites are now all met are automatically set to "Ready To Start." This works across stage boundaries -- for example, completing Engineering Approval in the Design stage will automatically unlock HOA Approval, OM Review, City Permit Approval, and Utility Permit Approval in the Permitting stage. You do not need to manually change dependent tasks to Ready To Start.

### Task History

Click the arrow icon next to any task to expand its history. The history shows every status change with:

- Date and time
- Previous status and new status
- Reason (if applicable)
- Who made the change
- "(cascade)" marker if the change was triggered by a revision cascade

### Reason Selection

When setting a task to Pending Resolution or Revision Required, you must select a reason:

- **Pending Resolution reasons** are specific to each task (e.g., "Customer Unresponsive" for Welcome Call, "Missing Attic Pics" for Survey Review)
- **Revision Required reasons** are specific to each stage
- If no predefined reasons exist for a task, a free-text input appears instead

## @Mentions and Notifications

NOVA includes an @mention system for tagging team members in project notes. This makes it easy to loop in other PMs, leadership, or the design team on specific projects.

### How to Mention Someone

1. Open the Project Panel and go to the Notes tab (or a per-task notes area)
2. Type `@` in the note input
3. An autocomplete dropdown appears showing active team members
4. Select a name from the dropdown to insert the mention
5. Submit the note as usual

### How Mentions Appear

Mentioned names render as green highlighted text in the note, making them easy to spot at a glance.

### Notifications

When you are mentioned in a note:

- A notification appears on the **bell icon** in the top navigation bar
- The bell shows an unread count badge when you have new mentions
- Click the bell to see all your notifications with the project name and note context
- Notifications are marked as read when you view them

### When to Use @Mentions

- Loop in another PM when a project needs their input
- Tag leadership to flag an issue or escalation
- Notify the design team about a change order or revision
- Alert the funding team when a milestone needs attention

### Database

Mention notifications are stored in the `mention_notifications` table. Migration: `supabase/015-mentions.sql`. Each notification records the note, the mentioned user, who made the mention, and the project.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Daily PM Workflow

1. **Start at Command Center** -- Check your Overdue, Blocked, and Critical sections first
2. **Switch to Queue** -- Work through your projects top to bottom
3. **Update tasks as you go** -- Keeping task statuses current triggers automations and keeps SLA accurate
4. **Add notes** -- Document customer interactions, decisions, and blockers in the Notes tab
5. **Check Schedule** -- Verify upcoming surveys, installs, and inspections

### Keeping SLA Healthy

- Update task statuses promptly when work is done
- When a task is genuinely blocked, set it to "Pending Resolution" with the right reason -- this sets the blocker automatically so leadership can see it
- When a task needs rework, use "Revision Required" -- be aware this will cascade-reset downstream tasks
- Avoid leaving tasks in "In Progress" for extended periods; if work stops, move back to Ready To Start or set to Pending Resolution

### Search Tips

- Search works across customer name, project ID, and city on most pages
- Type at least 2 characters to see results
- AHJ and Utility searches in the project panel and new project modal use autocomplete -- type to see suggestions from the database

### Creating Projects

When creating a new project:

- Fill in all required fields (marked with red asterisk): Customer Name, Address, Phone, Email, Dealer, and Financier
- The system automatically generates the next available project ID
- A Google Drive folder structure is automatically created with 16 subfolders
- Initial evaluation tasks are automatically set to "Ready To Start"
- A stage history entry is created

### Exporting Data

- Use the Export button on the Command Center to download project data as CSV
- A field picker lets you choose which columns to include
- The export includes all projects matching your current filters

### Understanding Dispositions

| Disposition | Meaning | Where It Appears |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| Sale (or null) | Active project in the pipeline | Command, Queue, Pipeline, Analytics, Funding, Audit |
| Loyalty | Existing customer, additional work | Command (separate section), Queue, Audit |
| In Service | Completed, post-installation | Command (separate section) |
| Cancelled | No longer active | Excluded from all active views |

### Disposition Workflow

Dispositions follow a specific progression -- you cannot skip steps:

```
Sale --> Loyalty --> Cancelled
```

- From **Sale**, you can only move to **Loyalty** (not directly to Cancelled)
- From **Loyalty**, you can move to **Sale** (reactivate) or **Cancelled**
- From **In Service**, you can only move back to **Sale**
- From **Cancelled**, you can only move back to **Loyalty** (reactivate)

This ensures projects go through the Loyalty step before cancellation, giving the team a chance to retain the customer.

### PM Assignment

The PM field is a dropdown populated from active users in the system. When you change a PM:

- Select the new PM name from the dropdown in the project's Info tab (edit mode)
- Both the display name and the PM's user ID are saved
- The project will immediately appear in the new PM's Queue

### Color Reference

Throughout the system, colors have consistent meanings:

- **Green** -- On track, complete, healthy
- **Blue** -- In progress, active work
- **Amber/Yellow** -- At risk, needs attention, warning
- **Red** -- Critical, blocked, overdue, needs immediate action
- **Indigo** -- Scheduled
- **Gray** -- Not ready, inactive, or neutral
- **Pink** -- Service calls

### Common Task Status Flows

A typical task progresses through statuses in this order:

```
Not Ready --> Ready To Start --> In Progress --> Complete
```

If something goes wrong:

```
In Progress --> Pending Resolution --> (resolved) --> In Progress --> Complete
```

If rework is needed:

```
Complete --> Revision Required --> (reworked) --> In Progress --> Complete
```

### Keyboard and Browser Tips

- Use your browser's back button to return to the previous page
- Bookmark your most-used pages for quick access
- The system updates in real time -- if another team member makes changes, you will see them without refreshing
- If the page feels slow, try refreshing your browser

## Technical Architecture

### API Layer

NOVA uses a centralized API layer for all data operations. When you interact with the system -- updating a task, adding a note, or saving project details -- those operations go through a set of dedicated functions that handle communication with the database. This means consistent behavior and error handling across every page.

### Error Handling

If something goes wrong while using NOVA, you will see a "Something went wrong" screen instead of a broken page. From this screen:

- Click **Try Again** to reload the page and recover
- If the issue persists, click **Report Issue** to submit a bug report through the feedback system -- your name, email, and the page you were on are captured automatically
- The admin team is notified of all reported issues through the Admin portal's Feedback Manager

Errors are isolated to individual pages -- if one page encounters a problem, the rest of the application continues working normally.
